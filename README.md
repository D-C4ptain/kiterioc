# Kiterioc

A multiplatform IOC hunter for Cyber Threat Intelligence. 



Data measurement units can be classified into the following:

    Bit - The smallest unit of computer data measurement. Has the value of 0 or 1, which correspond to electronic values of on or off.
    Byte - Contains 8 bits and enough information to form and store at least a single ASCII character, for e.g. 'a'.
    KiloByte - Contains about 1024 Bytes.
    MegaBytes - Contains about 1024 KiloBytes.
    GigaBytes - Contains about 1024 MegaBytes.

There are larger units of data measurement as well. The following units have been used in this project.
KiloByte (KB) 	1024 Bytes
MegaByte (MB) 	1024 KiloBytes
GigaByte (GB) 	1024 MegaBytes

Output is in 'GB', you can easily modify sysinfo.py to any other unit.



Some regex patterns are overdoing it: better safe than sorry though!
